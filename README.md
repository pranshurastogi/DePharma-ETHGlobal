## Future of this project - 

-> We're trying to build event based registeration of vaccine by providing unique NFT to every user once he/she gets vaccinated. With POAP itself being under development, we can collaborate with it in near future to implement the exposable APIs and thus create healthcare related community polls and start fundraiser events for charity.

-> Integrting the platform with livepeer for users to go on a one-to-one consultation with a doctor. The user will also hold the sole access rights of viewing and transferring his documents and videos [Will be enabled from smart contract].

-> Onboarding of users and providing authentic news regulated by the validators.
